Creates three custom blocks for OVPRED-affiliated websites:

1. Contact information
The contact information block has an address text area and three text fields for
phone, fax and webmaster email.

This block gets pre-populated with the defaults that are used on
research.uiowa.edu, the main OVPRED website, with the understanding that
departmental/affiiated websites will want to tweak and use their own contact
information.

2. Thank a staff member
This block is a link to the thank a staff member form on the OVPRED website.

3. Social links
This block provides YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook URL fields for populating
links to a website's social profiles. If a field is empty, it will not show on
the site and no default values are given. If all fields are empty, the block
will not show.
